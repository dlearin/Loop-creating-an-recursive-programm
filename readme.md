Create a JavaScript program that runs in the browser.

The program will generate a random number between 1 and 100 that we do not know. The program will ask from a prompt window to enter a number between 1 and 100. If the number entered by us in the prompt window is less than the random number generated by the program, an alert window should appear indicating that the number is "higher".

If, on the other hand, the number entered in the prompt window is greater than the one generated by the program, an alert window should appear indicating that the number is "lower".

This whole process will be repeated until little by little with the tracks of “Higher” and “Lower”

Let's guess the random number generated by the program. At that time it will appear on the website the message: “Correct! You have guessed it in x attempts” where x corresponds to the number of attempts consumed in finding out the no.
